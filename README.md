Traditional methods of OCR – mostly character level classification methods – do not apply as well to Indic scripts,
such as Devanagari, as they do to the Roman script. Here, we propose a novel transformer
based approach to attack this problem. Our solution relies on a Transformer-based OCR model (Li et al. 2021) and leverages the architecture to predict text at a word level instead
of at the character level. Even at an early stage, results seem promising with a character error rate of only 3.51%.
